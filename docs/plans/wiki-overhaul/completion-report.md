### Manual navigation journey testing

**Persona 1: New player trying to install a mod**
- Entry: Home.md → "Start here" table → "Install or troubleshoot a mod" row
- Path: Home → HoloPatcher#installing-mods → Concepts → Mod-Creation-Best-Practices
- Also: Learning paths → "New player" → HoloPatcher#installing-mods → Concepts#resource-resolution-order
- Result: ✅ Clear path from front door to install guide to troubleshooting. No archive/implementation clutter in the way.

**Persona 2: First-time mod author trying to package a patcher-based mod**
- Entry: Home.md → "Start here" table → "Author a patcher-based mod" row
- Path: Home → HoloPatcher#mod-developers → TSLPatcher-Data-Syntax#2dalist-syntax → TSLPatcher-GFF-Syntax#gfflist-syntax
- Also: Learning paths → "First mod author" → Mod-Creation-Best-Practices → format pages
- Result: ✅ Author workflow flows from packaging guide through syntax references. Cross-links to TSLPatcher's-Official-Readme for historical context.

**Persona 3: User trying to edit resources through Holocron Toolset**
- Entry: Home.md → "Start here" table → "Edit resources in a GUI" row
- Path: Home → Holocron-Toolset-Getting-Started → Holocron-Toolset-Core-Resources → Holocron-Toolset-Module-Resources
- See also links: Getting-Started → Blender-Integration, Indoor-Map-Builder-User-Guide, Mod-Creation-Best-Practices, Concepts
- Result: ✅ Visual walkthrough with screenshots from entry through all resource tabs.

**Persona 4: User trying to understand why a file wins in-game**
- Entry: Home.md → "Start here" table → "Understand why a file wins in-game" row
- Path: Home → Concepts → Resource-Formats-and-Resolution → Container-Formats#key
- Also: Concepts#resource-resolution-order explains the full precedence chain
- Result: ✅ Single authoritative explanation of resolution order. No competing pages.

**Persona 5: Tool author trying to implement or validate a format**
- Entry: Home.md → "Core reference pages" → Resource-Formats-and-Resolution
- Path: Resource-Formats-and-Resolution → (resource type table) → relevant format page (GFF, Container, 2DA, MDL, NSS, etc.)
- Each format page: structure/fields section, implementation references, cross-references
- Also: Learning paths → "Tool author or contributor" → Resource-Formats-and-Resolution → reverse_engineering_findings → Wiki-Conventions
- Result: ✅ Format index routes to per-format pages with binary layout, implementation links, and cross-references.

**Persona 6: Advanced contributor trying to find reverse-engineering backing material**
- Entry: Home.md → "Core reference pages" → reverse_engineering_findings
- Path: reverse_engineering_findings → subsystem sections → archive pages (engine_rendering, game_objects, resource_formats, toolset, tslpatcher)
- Also: migrated docstring archives for PyKotor-specific RE notes
- Result: ✅ Hub organizes by subsystem. Archive pages preserve evidence. Format pages cross-link to RE hub.

### Intentionally preserved historical pages

| Page | Reason |
|------|--------|
| Bioware-Aurora-Core-Formats.md | Official BioWare Aurora Engine documentation — authoritative upstream spec |
| Bioware-Aurora-Module-and-Area.md | Official BioWare Aurora Engine documentation — authoritative upstream spec |
| Bioware-Aurora-Creature.md | Official BioWare Aurora Engine documentation — authoritative upstream spec |
| Bioware-Aurora-Items-Economy-and-Narrative.md | Official BioWare Aurora Engine documentation — authoritative upstream spec |
| Bioware-Aurora-Spatial-and-Interactive.md | Official BioWare Aurora Engine documentation — authoritative upstream spec |
| Bioware-Aurora-Conversation.md | Official BioWare Aurora Engine documentation — authoritative upstream spec |
| TSLPatcher's-Official-Readme.md | Primary historical and technical source for TSLPatcher behavior — preserved as-is |
| TSLPatcher_Thread_Complete.md | Historical release thread archive — preserved for provenance and community context |

### Pages repositioned rather than rewritten

| Page | Rationale |
|------|-----------|
| reverse_engineering_findings_archive_*.md (5) | Archive-support pages demoted from direct navigation to hub-routed evidence. Content preserved; role changed from reader-facing to contributor/provenance reference. |
| reverse_engineering_findings_py_kotor_migrated_*.md (2) | Migrated docstring archives retained for provenance tracing. Not part of primary navigation. |
| Kit-Structure-Documentation.md | Project structure reference retained as specialized contributor doc. |
| Qt-ItemView-Selection-and-RobustTableView.md | UI framework reference retained for Holocron Toolset developers. |
| UTC-Editor-Field-Types-AgentDecompile.md | AgentDecompile RE findings retained for contributor reference. |

### Uncited-claim reconciliation

The wiki's editorial approach handles citation at two levels:

1. **Hub and concepts pages** (Home, Concepts, Resource-Formats-and-Resolution): All carry explicit "Verified against implementations" blocks citing ≥3 independent codebases (PyKotor, reone, KotOR.js, Kotor.NET). Claims are supported by inline implementation references.

2. **Format reference pages** (GFF, Container, 2DA, MDL, NSS, Audio, Texture, Level-Layout, LTR, NCS): Each has per-section Implementation and Cross-reference blocks with code-level entry points. Factual claims are supported by the format structure itself plus cross-references.

3. **Workflow and tutorial pages** (Mod-Creation-Best-Practices, HoloPatcher, Holocron Toolset family, tutorials): Cite community sources (DeadlyStream, LucasForums Archive) inline for workflow context and historical claims. Technical behavior defers to format pages.

4. **RE archive pages**: Evidence-index pages by design — source inventories are their primary content.

5. **Preserved source pages**: Not subject to citation review (immutable historical artifacts).

No claims were identified as requiring downgrade to "inferred" or removal as inaccurate. Wiki-Conventions.md now codifies the inline citation rule for future maintenance.

### Unresolved ambiguities and future follow-up

- **NSS-File-Format.md** (282KB) and **2DA-File-Format.md** (207KB) are the largest single pages. Future work could split them if readability suffers, but current anchor-based navigation works.
- **SHA pinning**: 5 URLs pointing to the deleted `reubenduncan/kotor` repo remain unpinnable. The repo itself is gone; links serve as historical references only.
- **verify_anchors.py** and **verify_toc.py** are NSS-specific validators. A general-purpose anchor validator for all wiki pages would be a useful future addition.
- **Community source coverage**: DeadlyStream and LucasForums Archive citations could be expanded on tutorial pages.
