"""This module handles classes relating to editing LIP files.

LIP (Lip Sync) files contain animation data for synchronizing character mouth movements
with voice-over audio. Each LIP file contains a series of keyframes that specify mouth
shapes (visemes) at specific timestamps, allowing the game engine to animate character
lips during dialogue playback.

Observed retail behavior:
----------
    KotOR streams ``LIP `` / ``V1.0`` lip-sync blobs keyed to VO lines: a float duration,
    a keyframe count, then repeating ``(timestamp, viseme id)`` pairs as in the binary layout
    below. It has been observed that retail builds load these through the same resource pipeline
    as other table data.

    Third-party GitHub URL lines removed from this module are archived at
    ``wiki/reverse_engineering_findings_lip_data_github_urls_pre_scrub.md``.
