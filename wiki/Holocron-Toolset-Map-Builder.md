# Holocron Toolset: Map Builder (Indoor Map Builder)

The Map Builder creates new playable areas from existing room models without 3D modeling tools. Open it from the Main Window via **Tools** → **Indoor Map Builder**.

You select models and insert them into the map; models can be attached to each other (shown by a green line between connections). When the layout is ready, **File** → **Build** outputs a module file to the game's `Modules/` folder, ready to warp into.

## Kits

Kits are collections of models from specific game areas. The toolset does not ship with kits; you must download them first (prompted when the window opens, or **File** → **Download Kits**).
