# PyKotor Resource Format Engine Notes

PyKotor's `resource/formats/` modules mirror executable-level parsing rules for the binary resource formats used by KotOR and TSL. The sections below preserve function addresses, call chains, struct layouts, and runtime behavior derived from disassembly of both executables.

For the condensed RVA lookup tables, see [Appendix: PyKotor resource/formats symbols](reverse_engineering_findings#pykotor-resource-formats-symbols). For the companion MDL binary I/O analysis, see [MDL module engine notes](reverse_engineering_findings_py_kotor_migrated_io_mdl).

This page is a contributor-facing appendix, not the main entry point for readers learning a format. Start with [Reverse Engineering Findings](reverse_engineering_findings) for the synthesis layer, then use this page when you need preserved call chains, addresses, or migrated implementation notes.

Some sections still contain explicit `TODO` markers where K1 and TSL have not yet both been confirmed. Treat those lines as incomplete reverse-engineering notes rather than settled engine facts.

## ASCII walkmesh — `bwm/io_bwm_ascii.py` (HEAD module + reader/writer reference text)

### Module reference text (lines 1–105)

```text
"""
ASCII reader/writer for KotOR walkmeshes (BWM/WOK).

This module implements 1:1 compatibility with the original game engine's ASCII walkmesh
parsing logic as found in both KotOR I and KotOR II (TSL).

The ASCII format is used by the Aurora toolset for exporting walkmeshes. The format consists
of text blocks that define:
- Node structure (AABB tree nodes)
- Position and orientation transforms
- Vertex arrays
- Face arrays with material assignments
- AABB tree construction

ASCII Format Structure:
----------------------
The ASCII walkmesh format uses a block-based structure similar to ASCII MDL files:

    node aabb
        position <x> <y> <z>
        orientation <x> <y> <z> <w>
        verts <count>
            <x> <y> <z>
            ...
        faces <count>
            <v1> <v2> <v3> <adj1> <adj2> <adj3> <adj4> <material>
            ...
        aabb
            <min_x> <min_y> <min_z> <max_x> <max_y> <max_z> <face_index>
            ...
    endnode

        - Functionally identical to K1 LoadMeshText
        - Same parsing logic, format structure, and behavior
        - Minor code size difference (650 vs 715 lines) due to compiler optimizations

        - Same quaternion construction logic as K1

Both implementations are functionally identical with the same parsing logic, format structure,
and behavior. The implementation in this module ensures 1:1 compatibility with both games.

Parsing Process Overview:
-----------------------
1. Format Detection:
   - LoadMesh checks file header to determine ASCII vs binary
   - ASCII format starts with "node" keyword

2. Line Reading:
   - LoadMeshString reads lines up to 256 bytes
   - Handles newline (0x0A) detection and null termination
   - Skips empty lines and leading whitespace

3. Keyword Parsing:
   - "node aabb" - Enters AABB node block
   - "endnode" - Exits node block
   - "position" - Reads 3 floats (x, y, z)
   - "orientation" - Reads 4 floats (x, y, z, w quaternion)
   - "verts" - Reads count, then N vertex lines (3 floats each)
   - "faces" - Reads count, then N face lines (8 integers each)
   - "aabb" - Reads AABB tree node lines (6 floats + 1 int each)

4. Face Processing:
   - Reads 8 integers per face: v1, v2, v3, adj1, adj2, adj3, adj4, material
   - Looks up material in surfacemat.2DA using C2DA::GetINTEntry with "Walk" column
   - Separates faces into walkable (first) and unwalkable (after) arrays
   - Sets adjacency_count to number of walkable faces

5. AABB Tree Construction:
   - Parses AABB nodes with bounding box (6 floats) and face index (1 int)
   - Swaps min/max if needed to ensure min < max
   - Applies epsilon expansion (0.01) to prevent floating-point precision issues
   - Maps face indices through adjacency array
   - Builds tree structure with parent-child relationships and split planes

6. Post-Processing:
   - Validates mesh data
   - Finalizes AABB tree structure
   - Computes adjacencies from geometry (shared edges)
   - Calls LoadDefaultMesh if no valid data found

    Both implementations are functionally identical with the same parsing logic.

    ASCII Format Details:
    --------------------
        The format uses a hierarchical node structure similar to ASCII MDL files:

        1. Node Block: "node aabb" - marks the start of the walkmesh node
           - Engine uses _strncmp(line, "node", 4) to detect
           - Checks for "aabb" substring to enter AABB node block
        2. Position: "position <x> <y> <z>" - walkmesh position offset
           - Engine uses sscanf("%f %f %f", &x, &y, &z)
           - Stored in mesh structure at offset 0x20 (Vector3 field)
        3. Orientation: "orientation <x> <y> <z> <w>" - quaternion rotation
           - Engine uses sscanf("%f %f %f %f", &x, &y, &z, &w)
           - If (x,y,z) is (0,0,0), creates identity quaternion (0,0,0,1)
           - Otherwise creates quaternion from axis-angle via Quaternion constructor
           - Stored in mesh structure at offset 0x38 (Quaternion field)
        4. Vertices: "verts <count>" followed by <count> lines of "<x> <y> <z>"
           - Engine allocates count * 12 bytes (3 floats per vertex)
           - Reads each vertex line with sscanf("%f %f %f", &x, &y, &z)
           - Performs coordinate quantization check (for binary format optimization)
        5. Faces: "faces <count>" followed by <count> lines with 8 integers:
           Format: "<v1> <v2> <v3> <adj1> <adj2> <adj3> <adj4> <material>"
           - Engine allocates count * 12 bytes (vertex indices) + count * 4 bytes (materials)
           - Reads each face line with sscanf("%d %d %d %d %d %d %d %d", ...)
           - Looks up material in surfacemat.2DA using C2DA::GetINTEntry(material_id, "Walk")
           - Separates into walkable (first) and unwalkable (after) arrays
           - Sets adjacency_count = number of walkable faces
        6. AABB Blocks: "aabb" followed by lines: "<min_x> <min_y> <min_z> <max_x> <max_y> <max_z> <face_index>"
           - Engine reads with sscanf("%f %f %f %f %f %f %d", ...)
           - Swaps min/max if min > max for any axis
           - Applies epsilon expansion (0.01) to prevent floating-point precision issues
           - Maps face index through adjacency array
           - Allocates AABB node structure (44 bytes = 0x2c bytes per node)
           - Builds tree with parent-child relationships and split planes
        7. End: "endnode" - marks the end of the node block
           - Engine uses _strncmp(line, "endnode", 7) to detect
           - Exits AABB node block parsing

    Parsing Process:
    ---------------
        The engine's parsing process (from LoadMeshText):

        1. Line-by-line reading using LoadMeshString (buffers up to 256 bytes per line)
           - LoadMeshString reads until newline (0x0A) or buffer full (255 chars)
           - Null-terminates the string
           - Advances buffer pointer and updates remaining byte count
        2. Whitespace stripping (leading spaces/tabs are ignored)
           - Engine skips leading whitespace before keyword detection
           - Uses _strncmp after stripping for keyword matching
        3. Keyword detection using _strncmp:
           - "node" / "node aabb" - enters AABB node block
             - Sets local variable (equivalent to _in_aabb_node = True)
           - "endnode" - exits node block
             - Sets local variable (equivalent to _in_aabb_node = False)
           - "position" - reads 3 floats via sscanf
           - "orientation" - reads 4 floats (quaternion) via sscanf
           - "verts" - reads count, then N vertex lines
           - "faces" - reads count, then N face lines (8 integers each)
           - "aabb" - reads AABB tree node lines
        4. Face processing:
           - Faces are read with 8 integers per line via sscanf
           - For each face, engine calls C2DA::GetINTEntry(surfacemat.2DA, material_id, "Walk", &result)
           - If result == 0, face is unwalkable; otherwise walkable
           - Faces are separated into two arrays:
             - Walkable faces stored first (adjacency_count = len(walkable_faces))
             - Unwalkable faces stored after walkable faces
           - Material lookup uses 2DA::GetINTEntry with "Walk" string to determine walkability
        5. AABB tree construction:
           - AABB nodes are parsed with 6 floats (bbox) + 1 integer (face index)
           - Engine swaps min/max if min > max for any axis
           - Applies epsilon expansion (0.01) to bounding box
           - Maps face index through adjacency array to get correct face reference
           - Allocates AABB node structure (44 bytes) and fills with data
           - Tree structure is built from parent-child relationships
           - Split plane calculation based on bounding box dimensions
        6. Post-processing:
           - Engine validates mesh data
           - Finalizes AABB tree structure
           - Computes adjacencies from geometry (shared edges)
           - Calls LoadDefaultMesh if no valid data found (local_b4 == 0)

### `BWMAsciiReader.load` reference text (lines 281–343)

```text
        """Loads an ASCII walkmesh file into a BWM instance.

        This implementation follows the exact parsing logic from both games:
        - KotOR I: swkotor.exe:0x00582d70 - CSWRoomSurfaceMesh::LoadMeshText
        - KotOR II: swkotor2.exe:0x00577860 - FUN_00577860 (equivalent to LoadMeshText)

        The method implements a line-by-line parser that processes ASCII walkmesh format
        exported by the Aurora toolset. It mirrors the engine's parsing logic exactly,
        including memory allocation patterns, data structure ordering, and error handling.

        Processing Logic:
        ----------------
            1. Read entire input into memory
               - Reads all bytes from source into input_data buffer
               - Initializes parsing state variables (_data_offset, _data_remaining, _in_aabb_node)
            2. Initialize parsing state
               - Sets position to null vector
               - Initializes empty lists for vertices, face_data, and aabb_data
               - Creates new BWM instance
            3. Loop through lines until EOF or error
               - Calls _load_mesh_string() to read each line (up to 256 bytes)
               - Strips leading whitespace
               - Detects keywords using startswith() (equivalent to engine's _strncmp)
            4. Parse keywords and data blocks
               - "node aabb" - Sets _in_aabb_node = True
               - "endnode" - Sets _in_aabb_node = False
               - "position" - Parses 3 floats, stores in BWM.position
               - "orientation" - Parses 4 floats (quaternion), currently not stored in BWM model
               - "verts" - Reads count, then N vertex lines, stores in vertices list
               - "faces" - Reads count, then N face lines (8 integers each)
                 * Separates walkable vs unwalkable based on SurfaceMaterial.walkable()
                 * Stores walkable faces first, then unwalkable faces
               - "aabb" - Reads AABB tree node lines (6 floats + 1 int each)
                 * Swaps min/max if needed
                 * Applies epsilon expansion (0.01)
                 * Stores in aabb_data list
            5. Build BWM structure from parsed data
               - Creates BWMFace objects from face_data tuples
               - Validates vertex indices against vertices list
               - Sets material on each face
               - Appends faces to BWM.faces in walkable-first order
            6. Separate walkable vs unwalkable faces
               - Uses SurfaceMaterial.walkable() method (equivalent to engine's 2DA lookup)
               - Walkable faces come first in BWM.faces array
            7. Construct AABB tree if present
               - Sets BWM.walkmesh_type to BWMType.AreaModel if aabb_data exists
               - Otherwise sets to BWMType.PlaceableOrDoor
               - NOTE: Full AABB tree construction with parent-child relationships
                 is deferred to the writer (engine builds tree during parsing)

    4. Vertices: "verts <count>" followed by <count> lines of "<x> <y> <z>"
    5. Faces: "faces <count>" followed by <count> lines with 8 integers:
       Format: "<v1> <v2> <v3> <adj1> <adj2> <adj3> <adj4> <material>"
       - Walkable faces come first (matching engine's adjacency_count ordering)
       - Unwalkable faces come after
    6. AABB Blocks: "aabb" followed by lines: "<min_x> <min_y> <min_z> <max_x> <max_y> <max_z> <face_index>"
    7. End: "endnode" footer

    Processing Logic:
    ----------------
    1. Extract unique vertices from faces (by identity, not value)
    2. Build vertex index mapping for face vertex references
    3. Separate faces into walkable and unwalkable (engine ordering)
    4. Write "node aabb" header
    5. Write position (from BWM.position)
    6. Write orientation (default identity quaternion: 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0)
    7. Write vertices block with count and vertex lines
    8. Write faces block with count and face lines (8 integers each)
       - Computes basic adjacency from shared edges (simplified)
       - Sets adj1-adj4 to adjacent face indices or -1 if no adjacency
    9. Write AABB tree nodes (if present and walkmesh_type == AreaModel)

    Example: "blending additive"
    Example: "upperleftcoords 256"

             0.031250 0.031250 0
             ...

    Commands are case-insensitive. Values can be integers, floats, booleans (0/1),
    strings (texture names), or multi-line coordinate arrays.

Note:
----
    The TXI class needs to be merged with the TXIBaseInformation and its subclasses
    at some point in an intuitive manner. This is a work in progress.
