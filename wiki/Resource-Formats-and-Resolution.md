# Resource formats and resolution

KotOR does not load files by extension alone. The runtime resolves a resource as a `(ResRef, type ID)` pair, so `foo.utc`, `foo.utp`, `foo.uti`, and `foo.tga` are four different resources even when they share the same base name. PyKotor's registry is the best current single-source summary because each `ResourceType` member carries the numeric ID, canonical extension, broad content family, and declared engine support rather than only a flat filename mapping [[`BiowareEngine`](https://github.com/OpenKotOR/PyKotor/blob/master/Libraries/PyKotor/src/pykotor/resource/type.py#L49-L67), [`ResourceTuple`](https://github.com/OpenKotOR/PyKotor/blob/master/Libraries/PyKotor/src/pykotor/resource/type.py#L147-L172), [`ResourceType`](https://github.com/OpenKotOR/PyKotor/blob/master/Libraries/PyKotor/src/pykotor/resource/type.py#L175-L209)].

This page is the wiki SSOT for KotOR-facing resource IDs, the Odyssey-specific extension block that older Aurora tables often omit, and the relationship between loose files, module capsules, and global archives. Community documentation and tool history line up with that model: Holowan-era install guidance distinguishes Override files, module files, lips, and TLK placement, while xoreos and related tooling treat KotOR resource handling as a typed, container-aware pipeline rather than a loose bag of files [[Darth333's install guide](https://www.lucasforumsarchive.com/thread/129789-guide-for-the-newbie-what-tools-do-i-need-to-mod-kotor-how-to-install-mods), [xoreos KotOR wiki page](https://wiki.xoreos.org/index.php?title=Knights_of_the_Old_Republic), [xoreos 0.0.6 release notes](https://xoreos.org/blog/2020/08/03/xoreos-0-dot-0-6-elanee-released/)]. For the broader prose on precedence, override behaviour, module capsules, KEY/BIF, and language IDs, see [Concepts](Concepts).

## Resource resolution order

Full prose (resource manager demands, KEY's role, override vs [MOD/ERF](Container-Formats#erf)/[RIM](Container-Formats#rim)): **[Concepts — Resource resolution order](Concepts#resource-resolution-order)**.

**Operational summary:**

1. Loose files in `Override` win first. That is why classic mod-install instructions tell users to drop most replacement assets there, and why collision-heavy mods break when they overwrite the same filename without a patcher [[Holowan install guide](https://www.lucasforumsarchive.com/thread/129789-guide-for-the-newbie-what-tools-do-i-need-to-mod-kotor-how-to-install-mods), [Holowan load-order thread](https://www.lucasforumsarchive.com/thread/206128-load-order)].
2. Module-local containers come next. KotOR commonly loads module data from [MOD](Container-Formats#erf), [ERF](Container-Formats#erf), or [RIM](Container-Formats#rim) capsules, and save-specific capsules can temporarily shadow shipped module resources when the game is working from save-state copies instead of pristine module assets [[Concepts](Concepts#resource-resolution-order), [`RIM`](https://github.com/OpenKotOR/PyKotor/blob/master/Libraries/PyKotor/src/pykotor/resource/type.py#L417-L419), [`MOD`](https://github.com/OpenKotOR/PyKotor/blob/master/Libraries/PyKotor/src/pykotor/resource/type.py#L249-L250), [`SAV`](https://github.com/OpenKotOR/PyKotor/blob/master/Libraries/PyKotor/src/pykotor/resource/type.py#L299-L300)].
3. Global shipped resources then fall back through [KEY](Container-Formats#key)/[BIF](Container-Formats#bif), which is why extraction tools and modding references treat KEY as the index and BIF as the payload store rather than two independent formats [[Container-Formats](Container-Formats#key), [`KEY`](https://github.com/OpenKotOR/PyKotor/blob/master/Libraries/PyKotor/src/pykotor/resource/type.py#L2110-L2110), [xoreos 0.0.6 release notes](https://xoreos.org/blog/2020/08/03/xoreos-0-dot-0-6-elanee-released/)].
4. `dialog.tlk` is resolved through its own string-reference path. Patchers therefore append StrRefs and then inject those numeric values into 2DA, GFF, SSF, or script data instead of shipping whole-table replacements [[Deadly Stream TSLPatcher page](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1039-tsl-patcher-tlked-and-accessories/), [TSLPatcher TLKList Syntax](TSLPatcher-TLKList-Syntax)].

The practical modder rule that emerged from Holowan still holds: avoid blind overwrites, prefer data patching for shared files, and treat identical filenames in Override as a load-order conflict rather than a mergeable state [[Holowan load-order thread](https://www.lucasforumsarchive.com/thread/206128-load-order)].

## ResRef and resource type

**ResRef** is the base resource name. **Resource type** is the numeric discriminator that says whether that name is a creature template, placeable template, compiled script, model, texture metadata file, or something else entirely. KotOR resolves those two pieces together, so the type ID is not optional bookkeeping: it is part of the lookup key [[Concepts — ResRef](Concepts#resref-resource-reference), [`ResourceType`](https://github.com/OpenKotOR/PyKotor/blob/master/Libraries/PyKotor/src/pykotor/resource/type.py#L175-L209)].

PyKotor's registry is especially useful because it records more than ID and extension. Each row also carries a broad category, a `contents` family such as `binary`, `plaintext`, `gff`, `erf`, or `lips`, and a `supported_engines` tuple. That makes it possible to distinguish "valid KotOR runtime type", "shared BioWare heritage type", and "tooling-only or unknown-support helper" instead of collapsing them into one giant undifferentiated list [[`ResourceTuple`](https://github.com/OpenKotOR/PyKotor/blob/master/Libraries/PyKotor/src/pykotor/resource/type.py#L147-L172)].

Use the tables on this page with the following reading rules:

- **Type ID** is the canonical numeric value stored by containers and resource managers.
- **Contents** tells you the storage family, which matters for whether a file is raw binary, text, [GFF](GFF-File-Format)-backed, [ERF](Container-Formats#erf)-backed, or LIP-specific.
- **Engine support** should be read as "known/declared support in the registry", not "confirmed retail usage in every shipped title". Some entries survive in the registry because KotOR tooling inherits broader Aurora/Odyssey lineage [[`BiowareEngine`](https://github.com/OpenKotOR/PyKotor/blob/master/Libraries/PyKotor/src/pykotor/resource/type.py#L49-L67)].

**Language IDs** (`dialog.tlk`, localization): [Concepts — Language IDs](Concepts#language-ids-kotor).

## Resource Type Identifiers

KotOR uses the inherited Aurora `0x0000-0x0812` range plus an Odyssey-specific extension block beginning at `3000`. Older community tables often stop before that Odyssey block or describe some legacy IDs only as "unknown", even though modern code and tooling can now classify them more precisely [[`ResourceType`](https://github.com/OpenKotOR/PyKotor/blob/master/Libraries/PyKotor/src/pykotor/resource/type.py#L231-L238), [`ResourceType`](https://github.com/OpenKotOR/PyKotor/blob/master/Libraries/PyKotor/src/pykotor/resource/type.py#L411-L479)].

### Common KotOR resource types

| Resource | Type ID | Contents | Engine support | Typical use |
| -------- | ------- | -------- | -------------- | ----------- |
| [2DA](2DA-File-Format) | `0x07E1` | binary table | Aurora, Odyssey, Eclipse | Gameplay tables, progression data, spell rows, appearances, and shared configuration |
| [ARE](GFF-Module-and-Area#are) | `0x07DC` | GFF | Aurora, Odyssey | Area metadata |
| [DLG](GFF-Creature-and-Dialogue#dlg) | `0x07ED` | GFF | Aurora, Odyssey, Eclipse | Dialog trees and conversation state |
| [ERF](Container-Formats#erf) / [MOD](Container-Formats#erf) / [SAV](Container-Formats#erf) / [RIM](Container-Formats#rim) | `0x270D` / `0x07DB` / `0x0809` / `3002` | container | Aurora/Odyssey, Odyssey | Capsule-style module, save, and shipped-area containers |
| [GFF](GFF-File-Format) | `0x07F5` | GFF | Aurora, Odyssey, Eclipse | Structured binary payload family used by most UT*, DLG, GIT, IFO, JRL, GUI, and related resources |
| [GIT](GFF-Module-and-Area#git) / [IFO](GFF-Module-and-Area#ifo) | `0x07E7` / `0x07DE` | GFF | Aurora, Odyssey | Module instance state and module metadata |
| [LIP](Audio-and-Localization-Formats#lip) / `BIP` | `3004` / `3028` | lips | Odyssey | Lip-sync timing and related facial timing data |
| [LYT](Level-Layout-Formats#lyt) / [VIS](Level-Layout-Formats#vis) / [PTH](GFF-Spatial-Objects#pth) | `3000` / `3001` / `3003` | plaintext / plaintext / GFF | Odyssey | Area layout, room visibility, and path data |
| [MDL](MDL-MDX-File-Format) / [MDX](MDL-MDX-File-Format) | `0x07D2` / `3008` | binary | Aurora/Odyssey/Eclipse, Odyssey | Model hierarchy plus mesh-sidecar data |
| [NCS](NCS-File-Format) / [NSS](NSS-File-Format) | `0x07DA` / `0x07D9` | binary / plaintext | Aurora, Odyssey | Compiled and source NWScript |
| [SSF](Audio-and-Localization-Formats#ssf) / [TLK](Audio-and-Localization-Formats#tlk) | `0x080C` / `0x07E2` | binary | Aurora, Odyssey / Aurora, Odyssey, Eclipse | Soundset-to-StrRef mappings and localized talk table strings |
| [TPC](Texture-Formats#tpc) / [TGA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truevision_TGA) / [DDS](Texture-Formats#dds) / [TXI](Texture-Formats#txi) | `3007` / `0x0003` / `0x07F1` / `0x07E6` | binary / binary / binary / plaintext | Odyssey / shared / shared / Aurora, Odyssey | Common texture payloads and texture metadata |
| [UTC](GFF-Creature-and-Dialogue#utc) / [UTI](GFF-Items-and-Economy#uti) / [UTP](GFF-Spatial-Objects#utp) / [UTD](GFF-Spatial-Objects#utd) / [UTM](GFF-Items-and-Economy#utm) / [UTW](GFF-Spatial-Objects#utw) | `0x07EB` / `0x07E9` / `0x07FC` / `0x07FA` / `0x0803` / `0x080A` | GFF | Aurora, Odyssey | Creature, item, placeable, door, merchant, and waypoint templates |
| [WOK](Level-Layout-Formats#bwm) / [DWK](Level-Layout-Formats#bwm) / [PWK](Level-Layout-Formats#bwm) / `BWM` | `0x07E0` / `0x0804` / `0x0805` / `3005` | binary | Aurora, Odyssey / Odyssey | Walkmesh family for areas, doors, placeables, and Odyssey binary walkmesh assets |

The practical split is simple: most modders live in GFF resources, 2DA tables, scripts, talk tables, and models/textures, while engine and tool authors also need the Odyssey-specific `3000+` block because that is where layout, visibility, binary walkmesh, texture-container, and MDX sidecar types are declared [[`ResourceType` 2000-2063 block](https://github.com/OpenKotOR/PyKotor/blob/master/Libraries/PyKotor/src/pykotor/resource/type.py#L239-L307), [`ResourceType` 3000-3028 block](https://github.com/OpenKotOR/PyKotor/blob/master/Libraries/PyKotor/src/pykotor/resource/type.py#L411-L479)].

### Odyssey extension block (`3000+`)

These IDs are the biggest omission in many older KotOR summaries because they sit outside the classic Aurora range. In practice they cover exactly the kinds of assets that make Odyssey areas, rooms, visibility, lips, and texture/model sidecars work.

| Extension | Type ID | Contents | Typical KotOR role |
| --------- | ------- | -------- | ------------------ |
| [LYT](Level-Layout-Formats#lyt) | `3000` | plaintext | Area room/layout mapping |
| [VIS](Level-Layout-Formats#vis) | `3001` | plaintext | Room-to-room visibility graph |
| [RIM](Container-Formats#rim) | `3002` | binary container | Odyssey area/archive container |
| [PTH](GFF-Spatial-Objects#pth) | `3003` | GFF | Path and waypoint-network data |
| [LIP](Audio-and-Localization-Formats#lip) | `3004` | lips | Lip-sync timing |
| `bwm` | `3005` | binary | Odyssey binary walkmesh |
| `txb` | `3006` | binary | Texture-related Odyssey helper type retained in the registry |
| [TPC](Texture-Formats#tpc) | `3007` | binary | Primary Odyssey texture container |
| [MDX](MDL-MDX-File-Format) | `3008` | binary | Model mesh/geometry sidecar |
| `rsv` / `sig` | `3009` / `3010` | binary | Reserved or presently-unused Odyssey IDs |
| `mab` | `3011` | binary | Material-related binary type |
| `qst2` / `sto` | `3012` / `3013` | GFF | Odyssey quest/store-adjacent data types retained in the registry |
| `hex` | `3015` | binary | Hex-grid related helper type |
| `mdx2` / `txb2` | `3016` / `3017` | binary | Secondary model/texture helper types |
| `fsm` / `art` / `amp` / `cwa` | `3022` / `3023` / `3024` / `3025` | binary / plaintext / binary / GFF | State-machine, area-environment, brightness, and crowd-attribute helpers |
| `bip` | `3028` | lips | Binary lip-sync companion type |

All of those entries are declared as Odyssey-supported in the current registry, even when only a smaller subset is encountered in normal KotOR mod distribution workflows [[`LYT` through `BIP`](https://github.com/OpenKotOR/PyKotor/blob/master/Libraries/PyKotor/src/pykotor/resource/type.py#L411-L479)].

### Legacy and cross-engine IDs that still matter in KotOR tooling

Some registry members survive because KotOR shares lineage with broader Aurora/Odyssey tooling, not because every title uses them equally. The most relevant examples are `BMU`, `MPG`, `WMA`, `WMV`, and `XMV` for audio/video payload families; `HAK` and `NWM` from Aurora container history; and `BIK` for Bink video. They are worth keeping documented because extraction tools, archive browsers, and cross-engine libraries need one registry that can reason about both KotOR and its neighboring BioWare formats [[`BMU`-`XMV`](https://github.com/OpenKotOR/PyKotor/blob/master/Libraries/PyKotor/src/pykotor/resource/type.py#L231-L238), [`HAK`-`BIK`](https://github.com/OpenKotOR/PyKotor/blob/master/Libraries/PyKotor/src/pykotor/resource/type.py#L303-L307), [xoreos 0.0.6 release notes](https://xoreos.org/blog/2020/08/03/xoreos-0-dot-0-6-elanee-released/)].

### Extended classic registry table

All entries derive from PyKotor's [`ResourceType` enum in `type.py`](https://github.com/OpenKotOR/PyKotor/blob/master/Libraries/PyKotor/src/pykotor/resource/type.py); each member's `supported_engines` field is the authoritative source for engine support [[`BiowareEngine`](https://github.com/OpenKotOR/PyKotor/blob/master/Libraries/PyKotor/src/pykotor/resource/type.py#L49-L67), [`ResourceType` members L209-L480](https://github.com/OpenKotOR/PyKotor/blob/master/Libraries/PyKotor/src/pykotor/resource/type.py#L209-L480)]. Rows described as having "no known retail game files" are engine-registered types not observed in shipped KotOR archives.
